Once our client write a word in the search bar,
he recieves 2 results :  :neckbeard:  
1- a link from *MediaWiki* site = using fetch for the url of MediaWiki and assigning the valid URL for the `<a>` href , with adding a `textContent` for it. :milky_way:	  

2- a link form *The Guardian* new site. :milky_way:

- if we had more time to work on the code we would manage the errors more with details
- and the most challenging thing was abstracting the code.
